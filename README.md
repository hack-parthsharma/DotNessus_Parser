# dotNessus_Parser
A python parser for .nessus files that displays hosts and ports. Created this because the tenable Nessus scanner did not have the feature to display this information together.

This is a simple python command line parser which doesn't require any dependencies just feed the Nessus scanner `.nessus` exported file as a command line argument and get a html file as output.


### Usage
```bash
python3 dotNessus_Parser.py scanner.nessus
```
